Hello! My name is Shane Ethan Steer. I am a recent graduate from the University of Essex. I studied Computer Science and Game Development. The reason I wanted to become a game developer is to be able create games that I love and share them with people of all ages to experince and enjoy. To me there is no greater satisfaction than bringing joy to others through something I have created. Throughout my journey of becoming a game developer at university, I have learned alot and applied the knowledge I gained towards the games I make. I am looking forward to expanding my skillset and learning more about the game industry as I keep moving forward. I am currently looking for graduate jobs in order to kickstart my career in the games industry.
